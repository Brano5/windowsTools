# tabspace
tabspace is a small command line tool that converts tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs automatically in files. It also removes spaces at the end of lines.

It works with ANSI, UTF-8 and even UTF-16 (on Windows mostly referred to as Unicode) files alike.

The conversion is done so that the alignment always stays the same - the conversion does not simply replace the characters, but uses an algorithm to find out how the replacement has to be done.
