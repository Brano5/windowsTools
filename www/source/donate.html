        <p>
            If you like my tools and want to give me a little money
            for a pizza, you can do so via <a href="https://www.paypal.me/stefankueng">this link</a>.
            If you're not comfortable with PayPal or for whatever reason
            you can not use it, don't worry: it's the thought that counts
            and I appreciate it anyway.
