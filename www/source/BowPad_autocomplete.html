    <h2>auto-completion and code snippets</h2>

    <p>
        BowPad can scan files for function names and other words to be used
        in auto completion. While the automatic scan does a well enough job,
        sometimes you might want to provide your own word list for auto completion.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do that, create a file named <code>autocomplete.ini</code> in
        <code>%APPDATA%\BowPad</code> if you have BowPad installed, or in
        in the bin directory for portable versions of BowPad.
    </p>
    <p>
        BowPad can also insert code snippets. For example if you type
        <code>do </code> in a C/C++ file, you'll get a suggestion popup to
        insert a do-while code loop.
        Custom code snippets can be added to the same <code>autocomplete.ini</code>
        file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The format of that file is:
<pre class="prettyprint">
[language]
code=word1 word2 word3
snippet_do=do\n{\n} while(^);
snippet_for=for (^)\n{\n}
snippet_while=while (^)\n{\n}
</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>[language]</code> must be replaced with the lexer for which
        these settings apply, so e.g. <code>C/C++</code>, <code>C#</code>,
        <code>Ruby</code>, ...
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>code</code> line contains a space separated list of words
        used for auto completion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>snippet_</code> lines contain the code snippets. The part after
        the <code>_</code> char is the snippet trigger, and the value is
        the string/snippet to insert. The <code>^</code> char marks the place
        where the cursor is placed after the snipped is inserted.
    </p>
