    Evernote2Onenote requires .NET Framework 4.8. You can get this via Windows
    update or directly from <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="details">Details: how it works</h3>
    <p>
    You can export your Evernote notebooks as an ENEX file. This file is then used
    by Evernote2Onenote to import those notebooks into Onenote.

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>
    Evernote2Onenote requires that Onenote is installed.
    </p>
    <section class="important">
        <h2>Desktop version</h2>
        <p>
            The preinstalled versions of Onenote from the Windows App Store won't work.
            You need the <a href="http://www.onenote.com/">desktop version</a> of Onenote!
        </p>
    </section>

    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>
    Start Evernote2Onenote, then select the the options you want for your import.
    Usually the default options are good enough.
    Then click the "Import ENEX file" button, select the exported notebook file from Evernote.
    After that the import starts and imports all the notes into Onenote.
    </p>

    <section class="important">
        <h2>Evernote tags</h2>
        <h3>For Onenote that comes with Office:</h3>
        <p>
            Notes are imported to Onenote in a tab that has the same name as
            the tag the note has. If a note has multiple tags, that note is
            imported multiple times to Onenote, so you get duplicate notes!
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid duplicate notes, you should first remove duplicate tags
            from your notes in Evernote. The easiest way to do that is to
            create an empty new notebook, export your real notebook in <code>enex</code>
            format and uncheck <code>tags</code> from the export options. Then
            import that enex file into the new notebook. And then of course
            only import that new notebook into Onenote.
