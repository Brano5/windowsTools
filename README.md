# multiple tools

This repository contains multiple small tools and explorer plugins:

## StExBar: The ultimate tool for Windows Explorer

StExBar provides many useful commands for your everyday use of Windows explorer. And you can add as many custom commands on your own as you like.

## SkTimeStamp: Change file dates easily, directly from explorer

SKTimeStamp is a very simple shell extension which adds a new tab to the Windows Explorer properties dialog. On that new tab, you can change the file/folder date and time.

## tabspace

tabspace is a small command line tool that converts tabs to spaces or spaces to tabs automatically in files. It also removes spaces at the end of lines.

It works with ANSI, UTF-8 and even UTF-16 (on Windows mostly referred to as Unicode) files alike.

The conversion is done so that the alignment always stays the same - the conversion does not simply replace the characters, but uses an algorithm to find out how the replacement has to be done.

## FileTool

Lock files, create files and folders with any size and numbers.
Sometimes it's necessary to create a lot of test files, or just a few but very big ones. Or you need a thousand folders with a thousand files in each of them to test with your application. FileTool can do that for you.

Or you need to lock files to test how your application behaves if it can not access those files. FileTool can do that for you too.

## AAClr: Change Aero colors to match wallpaper

Windows 8 has a new feature where the Aero colors can be automatically adjusted according to the selected wallpaper.

This seems to be a nice feature, and AAClr implements this for Windows 7 as well.
